# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this survey and analysis project! Here’s how you can help:

## Ways to contribute
- Improve data cleaning and validation rules
- Add new visualizations or statistical summaries
- Extend sentiment/thematic analysis for open feedback
- Enhance the presentation deck with clearer storytelling
- Improve documentation and reproducibility

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` or the script `scripts/clean_and_analyze.py`.
4. Add or update tests/notebook assertions where relevant.
5. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots of key results.

## Code style
- Python: follow PEP8, use type hints where practical.
- Keep notebooks clean (restart + run all before committing).
- Commit meaningful changes; avoid committing huge intermediate artifacts.

## Data ethics
- Do not upload any personally identifiable information (PII).
- Ensure all visualizations respect respondent anonymity.

Thank you for contributing!
