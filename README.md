A compact, real-world research project analyzing feedback from 100 students about their experience with the Physics Wallah platform. The repository includes the original Google Form link, the raw response sheet (Excel), a polished slide deck, and a concise PDF report—designed to showcase end-to-end data collection, analysis, and presentation.

- Original survey form: https://forms.gle/45jCQ7ntKWpYTY6v8

## Highlights
- 100 respondents surveyed via Google Forms
- Structured data in Google Sheets/Excel and visualized with charts/graphs
- Executive-ready PowerPoint presentation and a brief PDF report
- Clear, reproducible approach for survey-based analysis

## Repository contents
- `Physics Wallah Survey  (Responses).xlsx` — Raw responses exported from Google Forms (Excel)
- `Physics Wallah Survey.pptx` — Slide deck summarizing approach and insights
- `Project Report PW.pdf` — Concise report suitable for quick review
- `Google Form Link.txt` — Short text file with the live survey link

## Problem & motivation
Learners engage with Physics Wallah for exam prep and conceptual understanding. This project measures the student experience—content quality, platform usability, perceived value, and overall satisfaction—to inform actionable improvements and highlight strengths that matter to students.

## Methodology (at a glance)
1. Survey design: multi-question Google Form covering demographics, usage, satisfaction, and open feedback
2. Data collection: 100 valid responses
3. Structuring: Google Sheets cleanup, Excel export
4. Analysis: descriptive stats, frequency distributions, cross-tabs, and visual summaries
5. Communication: slide narrative and a concise PDF report

## What’s analyzed
- Overall satisfaction & likelihood to recommend
- Perceived content quality and instructor effectiveness
- Platform usability (navigation, speed, reliability)
- Value for money and subscription preferences
- Study patterns: usage frequency, device preferences
- Open-ended feedback themes

> Note: This repository doesn’t include personally identifiable information. Aggregated insights are communicated via charts and summary text.

## How to explore
 - For code-based workflow: see the notebook in `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` or run the script in `scripts/clean_and_analyze.py`

## Reproducibility (manual)

## Reproducibility (code)
Use Python to automate cleaning, metrics, and figures.

Prerequisites: Python 3.10+ recommended.

```powershell
# From repository root
pip install -r requirements.txt
python .\scripts\clean_and_analyze.py
```

Outputs will be written to `artifacts/`:
- `artifacts/summary.md` — key stats, NPS-style score, sentiment summary
- `artifacts/figures/*.png` — autogenerated charts

### Run tests
Install dev requirements and run the test suite:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
```

## Tools used
 - Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, TextBlob) for reproducible analysis



## Data & privacy
- The code removes likely PII fields (e.g., name, email, phone) during processing.
- The sample cleaned CSV (`data/cleaned_responses.csv`) is illustrative; replace with your fully cleaned export if needed.
