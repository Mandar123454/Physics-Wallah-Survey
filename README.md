## Problem & motivation
Learners engage with Physics Wallah for exam prep and conceptual understanding. This project measures the student experience—content quality, platform usability, perceived value, and overall satisfaction—to inform actionable improvements and highlight strengths that matter to students.

## Methodology (at a glance)
1. Survey design: multi-question Google Form covering demographics, usage, satisfaction, and open feedback
2. Data collection: 100 valid responses
3. Structuring: Google Sheets cleanup, Excel export
4. Analysis: descriptive stats, frequency distributions, cross-tabs, and visual summaries
5. Communication: slide narrative and a concise PDF report

## What’s analyzed
- Overall satisfaction & likelihood to recommend
- Perceived content quality and instructor effectiveness
- Platform usability (navigation, speed, reliability)
- Value for money and subscription preferences
- Study patterns: usage frequency, device preferences
- Open-ended feedback themes

> Note: The code attempts to drop likely PII during processing. Aggregated insights are communicated via charts and summary text.

## How to explore
 - For code-based workflow: see the notebook in `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` or run the script in `scripts/clean_and_analyze.py`

## Reproducibility (manual)

## Reproducibility (code)
Use Python to automate cleaning, metrics, and figures.

Prerequisites: Python 3.10+ recommended.

```powershell
# From repository root
pip install -r requirements.txt
python .\scripts\clean_and_analyze.py
```

Outputs will be written to `artifacts/`:
- `artifacts/summary.md` — key stats, NPS-style score, sentiment summary
- `artifacts/figures/*.png` — autogenerated charts

### Run tests
Install dev requirements and run the test suite:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
```

## Tools used
 - Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, TextBlob) for reproducible analysis
